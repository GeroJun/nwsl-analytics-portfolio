# NWSL Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a soccer analytics learning module built around National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) event data. It is designed as both a portfolio piece and a teaching resource for introducing students to data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and basic modeling in sports analytics.

## Project overview

- **Goal**: Help learners use real NWSL data to answer performance and tactics questions with reproducible analysis.
- **Audience**: Undergraduate students or early‑career analysts with basic R and statistics knowledge.
- **Tools**: Quarto (`.qmd`), R, and CSV data files.

The module is organized to walk a student from raw data to a polished, web‑based report.

## Repository structure

- `index.qmd` / `index.html`  
  Main Quarto document and rendered site that introduces the module, learning goals, and analytical workflow.
- `data_cleaning.qmd`  
  Notebook focused on cleaning, transforming, and validating the NWSL event data set.
- `Soccer Codebook - Overview.csv`  
  Codebook describing variables in the soccer data (columns, definitions, and value coding).
- `student_template.qmd`  
  Starter Quarto file students can fill in as they complete the analysis.
- `student_answer_key.qmd`  
  Instructor version with one example solution and commentary.
- `index_files/`  
  Support files generated by Quarto for the HTML output.
- `soccer_image.png`  
  Image asset used in the rendered report.
- `soccer_module files.Rproj`  
  RStudio project file for convenient setup.

## Skills demonstrated

- Importing and cleaning real‑world sports event data.
- Documenting data with a clear, shareable codebook.
- Building a fully reproducible analysis pipeline in Quarto.
- Communicating findings with a published HTML report and well‑structured notebooks.
- Designing student‑facing and instructor‑facing versions of an analytics assignment.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/GeroJun/nwsl-analytics-portfolio.git`

`cd nwsl-analytics-portfoli`


2. Open `soccer_module files.Rproj` in RStudio (or open the folder in your preferred IDE).

3. Install required R packages (for example):

4. Render the main Quarto document:

`quarto render index.qmd`


This will regenerate `index.html` and any supporting files.

## How to use this module

- **As a learner**: Start from `index.html` or `index.qmd`, work through the narrative, then complete `student_template.qmd` using the codebook and examples.
- **As an instructor**: Use `student_template.qmd` as a handout and `student_answer_key.qmd` as a reference solution; adapt the prompts or data as needed for your course
